# üì¨ Create and Send Email Postcards üñºÔ∏è

In this exercise, you will use GitHub Copilot to create a web app for creating and sending email postcards. Let's spread some holiday cheer with beautiful digital postcards! üéÅ‚ú®

## Instructions

1. Create a new GitHub repository for this exercise and clone it to your local machine.

2. Create a new Angular project using the Angular CLI:
    
    ```bash
    ng new postcards
    ```

3. Generate a new component for the postcard creation form:

    ```bash
    ng generate component postcard-form
    ```

4. Start a new Copilot "Edits" session in Visual Studio Code. "Edits" is currently in preview. If something goes wrong, you can try the Copilot Chat instead.


3. These are the prompts you will use for Copilot. After each prompt, you will see the code generated by Copilot. Review the code and make any necessary changes. Then accept the code and move on to the next prompt.
